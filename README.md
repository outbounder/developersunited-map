# Developers map united #
Prototype project for increasing the aweareness of developers that they are not alone.

Initial code was developed and kindly hosted by http://xp-dev.com (http://svn2.xp-dev.com/svn/outboundz-developersmap)

## TODO/roadmap & help needed ##
* add geolocation support (capture after login location with marker owner's permission)
* add support for "enter key = submit" in login's password field
* tweet out every new login and counter (perfectly by @devsunited)

* update/upgrade openinviter as currently only gmail account login works. 
* move out the whole backend service to google app engine hosted solution
* upgrade the frontend to provide additional plugins support, ie load remote modules :)

* anything else?
