Prototype project for increasing the aweareness of developers that they are not alone.

Initial code was developed and kindly hosted by http://xp-dev.com (http://svn2.xp-dev.com/svn/outboundz-developersmap)

== TODO/roadmap & help needed ==
* update/upgrade openinviter as currently only gmail account login works. 
* move out the whole backend service to google app engine hosted solution
* upgrade the frontend to provide additional plugins support, ie load remote modules :)
